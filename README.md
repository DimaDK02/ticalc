# Calculator of car service
ticalc stands for **T**echnical **I**nspection **CALC**ulator

## How to launch the project:

1. I use [yarn (facebook package manager)](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
on this and other projects, please install it for comfortable work.
It's nice alternate to npm, really :)
2. clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/DimaDK24/ticalc.git`
3. go to project folder: `cd ticalc`
4. install packages: `yarn install`

6. have a look at other available scripts in `package.json`
